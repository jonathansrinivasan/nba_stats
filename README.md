# nba_stats

The setup for the application is very straight forward and follows the same steps as Professor Vikas Singh's demo. As long as the nba_games_data database is in the MAMP/WAMP server (by using our SQL to set up the back-end), you can open your web broswer and use the following URL (for Windows): http://localhost/Proj_2/index2.html

I am using a Windows so the URL for Mac might be different but I believe the URL for Mac is http://localhost:8888/Proj_2/index2.html

The NBA STATS web application is now up and running!
